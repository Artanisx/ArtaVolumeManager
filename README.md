# ArtaVolumeManager
A World of Warcraft mod to easily toggle between two audio profiles, one intended for use while playing on a voice chat application and one intended when playing solo.

There are two modes:

- **Group Mode**: This will set your Master Volume to 20% to allow you to more easily hear your party mates in voice chat.
- **Solo Mode**: This will set your Master Volume to 100%, since you are not in a voice chat and thus you don't need to lower the game volume to hear people.

The mod adds a small Minimap button. You just Left Click on it to toggle between the two modes. 

In a future version there will be a settings screen to customize the volume levels of the two profiles, but for now it's 20% for Group Mode and 100% for Solo Mode.

This is the standalone version of my own [Weak Aura: ArtaSettingsManager](https://wago.io/W8sMRHZ82), specifically tuned for the Audio Profiles toggle functionality.
