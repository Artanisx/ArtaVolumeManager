# ArtaVolumeManager
A World of Warcraft mod to easily toggle between two audio profiles, one intended for use while playing on a voice chat application and one intended when playing solo.

This is the standalone version of my own [Weak Aura: ArtaSettingsManager](https://wago.io/W8sMRHZ82), specifically tuned for the Audio Profiles toggle functionality.

## Slash commands
/avmtoggle - Toggles between the two profiles
